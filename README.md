The 2019 Chennai water crisis is an ongoing water crisis occurring in India, most notably in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. On 19 June 2019, Chennai city officials declared that "Day Zero", or the day when almost no water is left, had been reached, as all the four main reservoirs supplying water to the city had run dry.[1][2] Two years of deficient monsoon rainfall, particularly in late 2017 and throughout much of 2018 had led to this crisis.
